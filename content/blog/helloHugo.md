"Hello World", or should I say "Hello Hugo."

I've wanted to start blogging again for sometime now. 

What do they say?

> The best time to start a blog was 30 years ago, the next best time is today.

... or something like that. 

I'm playing around with some [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)themes tonight. Hopefully I'll manage to at least keep the content going. My intention is to keep this content short. My inspiration is something akin to the Today I Learned (til) format. Something I can utilize to reference things I learned, or found useful, or just wanted to share in that moment of time, like now.

So, here's to a new begining using Hugo. I'm sure a blog post could accompany this migration to hugo, but there are already plenty of those out [there](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-personal-website-with-github-pages-and-hugo-6c68592204c7). Mine is not unique. I was looking for a easy way to deploy a blog in public that deploys on push to main. Simple. 

Originally I wanted to create the site in pure Go, but have opted to use Hugo for now as it seems to have a large community, and again see above about deployment ease (free as well).
